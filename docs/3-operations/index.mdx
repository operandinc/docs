title: "Operations"

Once you've created some [Objects](/objects), you can perform operations on them. For example, searching through their content, forming relationships between objects, or using the indexed content itself to synthesize new content.

Currently, you can do the following operations on objects:

- [Content-Based Search](/operations/search#content-based): Search for the most relevant pieces of content (i.e. sentences/paragraphs) within your object index for a particular query. Perfect for surfacing ideas and concepts.
- [Object-Based Search](/operations/search#object-based): Search for the most relevant objects within your index for any particular query. Optimized for document-based search results pages, i.e. searching over documentation or webpages.
- [Related-Objects Search](/operations/search#related-objects): Search for the most related objects to any other given object within your index. Perfect for making "related to" / "similar documents" sidebar components, or finding relationships between objects (i.e. for CRMs).
- [Intelligent Question Answering](/operations/completions#question-answering): Answer natural language questions, using the indexed content of your objects as a ground-truth source of information. Great for synthesizing more complex answers, possibly from multiple different objects.
- [TypeAhead Completions](/operations/completions#typeahead): Intelligent autocomplete / predictive text, using indexed content as a ground-truth. Ideal for note taking apps, or writing-heavy systems.

## Filtering

For many of the above-mentioned operations, you can choose to filter the results by passing in a `filter` parameter. Essentially, this allows you to only search over a subset of your overall index. In general, filters operate solely on the associated [Properties](/objects#properties) of your objects.

Implicitly, all conditions specified in the top-level filter object are `AND`ed together. For example,

```json
{
  "foo": "bar",
  "number": 42
}
```

will match objects with the property `foo` equal to `bar` and the property `number` equal to `42`.

If an object has an array property, i.e. `"foo": ["bar", "baz"]`, filtering operations act as a contains operation. For example, an object with the array `foo` property containing `["bar", "baz"]` will match a filter `{"foo": "bar"}` as well as a filter `{"foo": "baz"}`.

Filters are composable and rather advanced, i.e. you can use operators to combine multiple filters, and to execute range queries on numerical properties:

```json
{
  "_and": [
    {
      "age": {
        "_gte": 25
      }
    },
    {
      "_not": {
        "_or": [
          {
            "age": 42
          },
          {
            "age": 69
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Equality operators on real-valued numerical properties, such as `42.69`, are supported (with a tolerance of `1e-6`).

In general, the following operators are supported:

- `_and`: Accepts an array of filters.
- `_or`: Accepts an array of filters.
- `_not`: Accepts a filter.

Range queries on numerical properties can be done using a sub-object with one or more of the following keys:

- `_gte`: Accepts a real-valued number.
- `_gt`: Accepts a real-valued number.
- `_lte`: Accepts a real-valued number.
- `_lt`: Accepts a real-valued number.
