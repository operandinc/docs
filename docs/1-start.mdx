Welcome to the Operand documentation! Here are some quick links to get you started:

- An [introduction to objects](/objects), the fundamental data structure used by the Operand API.
- The [core operations](/operations) you can do once you've indexed objects.
- [Guides](/guides) can give specific examples of building real-world applications with the API.

## Using the API

The API is accessible at `https://prod.operand.ai`. All requests must include an `Authorization` header with a valid API key, accessible from your [Operand dashboard](https://operand.ai/dashboard). If you don't have an account yet, you can [sign up here](https://operand.ai/auth).

Note: When specifying the `Authorization` header, you should not include a `Bearer` prefix.

## Client Libraries

We currently have two official client libraries for the Operand API:

- [TypeScript](https://github.com/operandinc/typescript-sdk)
- [Go](https://github.com/operandinc/go-sdk)

If we're missing an SDK for a programming language, feel free to [reach out](mailto:support@operand.ai)!
