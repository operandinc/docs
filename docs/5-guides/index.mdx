We've put together a number of guides to help you get started with whatever you're working on. If you're new to the API, we recommend reading a bit more about [Objects](/objects) and the core [Operations](/operations) you can do before starting to read / follow along with these guides.

Here are the guides we've written so far:

- [Semantic Search](/guides/semantic-search) explains how to integrate semantic search into your product or service with only a few lines of code. Furthermore, it discusses the differences between semantic and full-text search, and talks about some of the considerations when choosing between the two.
- [Personal Relationship Manager](/guides/prm) focuses on using the [related objects endpoint](/operations/search#related-objects) to build next-generation PRM system, which can automatically find and connect closely related people in your network.
- [Integrating with Quartz](/guides/quartz) explains how to add semantic-search to your [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/)-based web blog.
