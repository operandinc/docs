Semantic search is a relatively new idea, and has only recently been made viable due to the availability and innovation of the NLP space, and in particular, the advent of [transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)-based models. Using [Operand](https://operand.ai), you can add world-class semantic search to your application within minutes, no NLP background required.

## Background

Semantic search is a new way of searching and navigating large amounts of content. It works by transforming text into a high-dimensional vector representation (english: lots of numbers), and finding vectors (numbers) which are similar to each other. This is in contrast to traditional search engines (i.e. full-text search), which work by ranking documents based on matching keywords.

Semantic search is fundamentally different from full-text search engines, which keep track of the frequency of different keywords within a document (and their relative position to each other) + other ranking factors (i.e. [PageRank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank)).

## Considerations

As mentioned in our [search](/operations/search) documentation, Operand is, at its core, a semantic search engine. It is optimized for particular, well-defined use cases, and likely shouldn't be used for others. Specifically, **Operand is not a full-text search engine**.

Use cases where semantic search makes a lot of sense:

- When the user is searching for content or ideas, not specific keywords. For example, a blog, wiki, news site, or book often contains lots of ideas, and the user shouldn't need to know specific keywords in order to find the content they're looking for.
- When relationships between documents are important. For example, if a user is searching for a movie, they might also want to know other similar movies which are related to the one they're interested in.
- When the user doesn't necessarily know what they're looking for. Semantic search tends to yield better results on more abstract queries.

Use cases where semantic search may not be appropriate:

- When latency is top-priority. Semantic search is inherently very computationally expensive, and thus is usually (and probably should be) done server-side. This means that each search request requires a network round-trip.
- When users are likely searching for specific keywords. For example, a doctors office may want to search for a specific patient identifer or email address. Essentially, if you're looking for exact content matches, you probably don't want to use semantic search.

There is however, certain ways to get around most (if not all) of these limitations if the need arises. We've done it before on a per-case basis, and we're happy to chat about different options. If you have custom requirements for your search, please [reach out](mailto:support@operand.ai)!

## Integrating Semantic Search

If you've gotten here, it means you've probably decided semantic search is right for your use case, and want to start integrating it into your application. We've written a number of [guides](/guides) for more specific use cases, but the following is a general overview of how to get started for most applications.

We expect integration to take <30 minutes of developer time. If it takes longer, please [let us know why](/start#getting-help); we'll help you out, give you free credits for your trouble, and improve the system for the next user!

### (Optional) Multi-Tenancy

If you're using Operand in a "multi-tenant" environment, i.e. when multiple users use your software and have their own content / data, you'll need to build your Operand index in such a way to accommodate this. Specifically, we recommend creating a [collection](/objects#collection) for each user. Here's some pseudo-code using our TypeScript API for this:

```typescript
import { OperandV3 } from "@operandinc/sdk";

const operand = new OperandV3("<your api key>", "https://prod.operand.ai");

async function createUser(emailAddress: string) {
  const collection = await operand.createObject({
    type: "collection",
    metadata: {},
  });
  await database.storeUser({
    emailAddress,
    operandId: collection.id,
    // ...
  });
}
```

Essentially, when we create a new user, we also create a corresponding collection for them, and save the `id` of the collection in our database. This means we can use that `id` in the future to index content, or perform search queries.

### Indexing Content

Whenever the user creates some content in your app, be it a new note, a blog post, perhaps a new message in a chat app, you'll want to index that content in Operand so it can be searched. We support a large number of different content types (for a full list, [click here](/objects#types)), but for this example, we'll pretend the user is creating markdown content (i.e. for a blog).

```typescript
// Whenever the user creates a new blog post, we'll index it in Operand.
async function createBlogPost(user: User, title: string, content: string) {
  const obj = await operand.createObject({
    type: "markdown",
    metadata: {
      markdown: content,
      title,
    },
    // Optional, include if this is a multi-tenant environment.
    parentId: user.operandId,
  });
  await database.storeBlogPost({
    userId: user.id,
    operandId: obj.id, // Store the ID of the operand object with the blog post itself.
    title,
    content,
    // ...
  });
}

// If they edit a blog post, we want to propagate those edits.
async function updateBlogPost(post: BlogPost, title: string, content: string) {
  if (post.operandId) {
    await operand.updateObject(post.operandId, {
      type: "markdown",
      metadata: {
        markdown: content,
        title,
      },
    });
  }
  await database.updateBlogPost({
    id: post.id,
    title,
    content,
    // ...
  });
}

// Finally, if we delete a blog post, we'll delete it from Operand.
async function deleteBlogPost(post: BlogPost) {
  if (post.operandId) {
    await operand.deleteObject({
      id: post.operandId,
    });
  }
  await database.deleteBlogPost(post.id);
}
```

Note: If you want to do more advanced searches in the future, i.e. for example tagging documents or adding additional properties, you'll need to specify the `properties` field when you create/update objects. [Click here](/objects#properties) to learn more about this. Note: Properties are extremely powerful, and can be used to do extremely granular searches. For example, a user of ours has literally built up an entire role-based permission system on top of object properties.

### Searching Content

There's a number of different ways that you can search for content in Operand. The most basic of which is our [object-based search endpoint](/operations/search#object-based), which returns the top objects (along with a small snippet of text) that match a query.

```typescript
async function search(
  user: User,
  query: string
): Promise<
  {
    post: BlogPost;
    snippet: string;
  }[]
> {
  // We don't support empty queries.
  if (query.length === 0) {
    return [];
  }

  // Get the search results.
  const results = await operand.searchObjects({
    query,
    max: 5,
    // Optional, make sure the search only returns blog posts from this user.
    parentId: user.operandId,
  });

  // Get the blog posts from the database and return them along with the snippets.
  return await database
    .getBlogPostsByOperandIds(results.map((r) => r.id))
    .entries()
    .map(([index, post]) => ({
      post,
      snippet: results[index].snippet,
    }));

  // Alternative: If you don't want to do a query on the database to show the search results, you can index additional application-specific data when you're indexing the blog posts, and use that data (returned by searchObjects response) to render the search UI.
}
```

Taking this a step further, we can do other operations on the same index. For a full list, see [Operations](/operations). These include content-based search (finding specific content or ideas), related-object search (finding blog posts which are similar to each other), in addition to generative operations (intelligent question answering, typeahead).
